               I am a graduate of Franklin & Marshall College class of 2019 with a BA in Computer Science. 
               I am currently attending the Rutgers Full Stack Flex Bootcamp, and am well on my way to becoming a versatile front-end and back-end developer.
               I am currently versed in HTML5, CSS3, Boostrap, Materialize, javascript, and jquery as far as full stack development is concerned, I also have 
               been exposed to Python, Java, C++, and C. Throughout my undergraduate education I also gained exposure to algorithms, data structures, 
               Artificial Intelligence, and android app development. I have a wide range of skills, and through this hollistic approach to learning coding, I
               have learned best practices to write clean, reusable, and scalable code with performance in mind. This same hollistic approach included working
               on teams of different scale to produce deliverables on time, and through this experience I have gained team work, time managment, git/github, and 
               version control experience as well. Go to the portfolio page and select any of the projects there to see the deployed web pages, and go to the links
               page to get links to: the GitHub repos for those pages, my GitHub profile, my resume, and my LinkedIn profile.
