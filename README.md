#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to bring attention to my other works, and show off what I've made recently. It also gave me the opportunity to show off some of what I've learned as far as manipulating HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery to create a static webpage as far as content, but still be reactive to user scrolling, mouse movements, and of course clicks.

### Extra Details
Blotter.js was used to create the water ripple effect of my name as the user traces over it. Blotter.js can be found here: https://blotter.js.org/, and there are other text effects available there as well. Bootstrap was used to create the form at the bottom of the page, and Jquery was used to track user scrolling to switch the hovering navigation tabs in the top right from black to white, or white to black depending on the amount the user has scrolled. Jquery was also utilized to create on click events for all the images used to represent the github, deployed, or social media links on the page.
